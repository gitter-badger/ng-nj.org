  Gulp, Bower, and Yeoman are awesome tools for increasing your productivity.
  Official NG-NJ Yeoman Generator: Gulp-Angular

  <h2>Custom Directives</h2>
  Custom Directives allow you to put new commands on your HTML tags so you can break up your HTML into reusable components.

  <h2>Backend</h2>
  The official server side scripting language for NG-NJ is NodeJS.

  Firebase - Great for prototyping and making fully functional applications <i>fast.</i>

  MEAN Stack - This is a common backend setup that uses NodeJS and MongoDB.

  Loopback / Strongloop - allows you to write one query language and easily swap out different databases.


  <h2>UI Frameworks</h2>

  Angular Material - Official Angular ui from Google. Follows Google's Material Design specifications.
  Also includes a flexbox layout structure.

  Bootstrap - Classic framework for laying out a page on different screen sizes and includes some cool icons.
